# How to join the Server and dynmap
Dynmap: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/NVdynmap"> Something </a> 


JAVA IP: liamtheninja5.my.pebble.host

BEDROCK IP: liamtheninja5.my.pebble.host 
BEDROCK PORT: 25580

This server uses GeyserMC and Floodgate plugins to provide cross play for every verision of minecraft. So no matter waht verision you have you can join.

if you play on pc or phone you need to navagate to your "add server" button and put in the ip and if you are on bedrock (win10 or phone) put in the ip and the port

if you are on console you can join but you havft to change a wifi setting here is a video I found that shows you how to do so (I know people that have done this its safe)
